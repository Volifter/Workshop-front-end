# Front-end
This is a template repository for the front-end workshop

# Initialisation
To take part in this workshop, you need to
[use this repository as a template](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template)
to create your own repository. Once you have created a new repository from this
template, clone it and follow the attached [subject](subject.pdf).

# Automated tests
Whenever you are ready to submit your work and get feedback on your progress,
simply push your work to trigger a tests run.
Your test results will be available under the "*Automated tests*" workflow in the
**Actions** section of your repository. You can even watch them being
executed in realtime!\
You are free to push as many times as you need and there is no limitation on the
amount of test sessions you can trigger.\
Have fun!
